        <h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
        <p>My name is Andrew Ross, and I’m a Lexington, Kentucky native who currently resides in a small suburban town just outside the city. I’ve been playing and performing guitar in the Lexington area for over 15 years, and my journey with music has been incredibly rewarding. For the first 9 years, I received professional instruction, which helped me refine my skills and develop a deep understanding of the instrument.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of performing in a variety of settings—from intimate coffee shops to large venues, including churches with audiences of up to 3000 people. These experiences have shaped my approach to both playing and teaching guitar, and I bring that versatility into every lesson.</p>

        <p>My musical interests are vast and span multiple genres. Whether it's the timeless sounds of Country and Classic Rock, the energy of Rock n' Roll, the soulful melodies of Jazz, Blues and Big Band, the passion and drive of Metal, or the pop hooks of contemporary music, I have the ability to teach across a wide spectrum of styles. This broad knowledge helps me cater to the specific interests of my students and ensures that they get the most out of their lessons.</p>

        <p>Whether you’re just starting out on the guitar or you’ve already got some experience and want to take your skills to the next level, I’m here to help. I pride myself on creating a relaxed and encouraging learning environment, where students can feel comfortable to ask questions, laugh at our mistakes, and grow as musicians. With personalized lessons tailored to your goals, I can help you become the guitarist you’ve always wanted to be.</p>
